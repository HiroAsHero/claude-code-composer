# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Claude Code Multi-Agent Framework is a collaborative system designed to orchestrate multiple Claude Code agents working together on complex software development tasks. The framework enables parallel execution across multiple terminals, with specialized agents handling different aspects of development while coordinating through a central composer agent. This approach maximizes efficiency by allowing agents to work simultaneously on different components while maintaining a cohesive development process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Agent Orchestration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to coordinate multiple Claude Code agents with specialized roles, so that complex tasks can be broken down and executed efficiently in parallel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a project description THEN the system SHALL spawn a Composer Agent to coordinate the development process
2. WHEN the Composer Agent is initialized THEN the system SHALL enable it to spawn and manage multiple Sub-Agents with specialized roles
3. WHEN Sub-Agents are spawned THEN the system SHALL assign them specific roles (Developer, QA, Designer, Architect)
4. WHEN Sub-Agents are running THEN the system SHALL facilitate communication between them and the Composer Agent
5. WHEN tasks are assigned THEN the system SHALL respect dependencies between tasks across different agents

### Requirement 2: Project Documentation Generation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the framework to automatically generate comprehensive project documentation, so that I have clear requirements, design specifications, and task lists before implementation begins.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a project description THEN the Composer Agent SHALL generate a requirements document
2. WHEN requirements are defined THEN the Composer Agent SHALL generate a design document based on those requirements
3. WHEN design is completed THEN the Composer Agent SHALL generate a task list with dependencies
4. WHEN documents are generated THEN the system SHALL allow the user to review and approve them before proceeding
5. IF the user requests changes to any document THEN the system SHALL allow modifications before proceeding

### Requirement 3: Parallel Terminal Execution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each agent to run in its own terminal, so that I can monitor their activities separately and in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user approves the project documents THEN the system SHALL spawn multiple terminals
2. WHEN terminals are spawned THEN the system SHALL launch one Sub-Agent in each terminal
3. WHEN Sub-Agents are running THEN each terminal SHALL display the agent's activities in real-time
4. WHEN a Sub-Agent completes a task THEN its terminal SHALL show the completion status
5. IF a terminal process crashes THEN the system SHALL attempt to restart the corresponding agent

### Requirement 4: Task Management and Dependency Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tasks to be assigned to appropriate agents with proper dependency management, so that the development process follows a logical sequence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks are defined THEN the system SHALL identify dependencies between them
2. WHEN assigning tasks THEN the system SHALL respect the dependency order
3. WHEN a task is completed THEN the system SHALL update dependent tasks as ready for execution
4. IF a task fails THEN the system SHALL handle the failure and notify dependent tasks
5. WHEN all tasks are completed THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of the development process

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the framework to handle errors gracefully and maintain system stability, so that the development process can continue despite occasional failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Sub-Agent encounters an error THEN the system SHALL implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
2. IF a task fails repeatedly THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information
3. WHEN an agent becomes unresponsive THEN the system SHALL implement health checks and restart if necessary
4. WHEN the system encounters critical errors THEN it SHALL maintain state to allow recovery
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log structured information for debugging

### Requirement 6: Configuration and Customization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to configure and customize the framework, so that it can adapt to different project requirements and environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing the framework THEN the user SHALL be able to configure it via YAML files
2. WHEN configuring the framework THEN the user SHALL be able to define custom agent roles and behaviors
3. WHEN running the framework THEN the user SHALL be able to specify workspace directories
4. WHEN defining tasks THEN the user SHALL be able to customize task types and priorities
5. WHEN deploying the framework THEN it SHALL support different operating systems and environments

### Requirement 7: Package Distribution and Installation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the framework to be easily installable via standard Python package managers, so that I can quickly set it up in my development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the framework is published THEN it SHALL be available on PyPI
2. WHEN installing the framework THEN users SHALL be able to use pip install
3. WHEN the framework is installed THEN it SHALL include all necessary dependencies
4. WHEN the framework is updated THEN users SHALL be able to upgrade via standard package managers
5. WHEN installing the framework THEN it SHALL provide clear documentation on usage

### Requirement 8: Command Line Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple and intuitive command line interface, so that I can easily invoke and control the framework.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the framework is installed THEN it SHALL provide a command-line entry point
2. WHEN using the CLI THEN users SHALL be able to specify project descriptions as arguments
3. WHEN running the CLI THEN users SHALL be able to configure workspace and configuration paths
4. WHEN the CLI is running THEN it SHALL provide progress information and status updates
5. WHEN the CLI encounters errors THEN it SHALL display helpful error messages
